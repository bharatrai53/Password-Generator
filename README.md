# Password-Generator

## Description
The Password Generator project was created so that I could utilize my skills learned is JavaScript to create a project that would randomly create a password based on user entered parameters such as the password length, characters included (UpperCase, LowerCase, Numbers, and Special) while teaching me how to implement conditional statements using if/else statements and for loops. 

## Usage
The password generator program can be used when a user wants to create a new password that will be secure and random. To utilize the project begin the program by selecting the 'generate password' button and follow the prompts to create a password. The first question will ask you to select a length, and from there, use the confirm dialog boxes to select the parameters that you would like to include in your password.
